# stm32mp1sign

Raison d'être:
Signing stm32mp1 headers is a STM closed source affair.
The signing tool is part of a large software package (CubeProgrammer).
And it is very cumbersome to try to integrate in a normal build environment.
But fortunately, all is needed is some plain cryptography.
stm32mp1sign is written in C and uses openssl.

stm32mp1sign is a C replacement for STM32MP_SigningTool_CLI (closed source) in STM32CubeProgrammer.
It is currently only capable of handling stm32 v1 headers present in the stm32mp15x series.

Functionally implemented from the descriptions at:

**_Beware. Fusing a device	means you can never undo the key.
If you loose the private key or	password, then that's it.
No more	signing	new images.
If you also close the device then there	will be	no other way out.
You have been warned!_**

1. Generate keys. Here you can use STM32CubeProgrammer or regular OpenSSL.
This should get	you a prime256v1 (default) curve key with	the privkey encrypted in AES256 (default).
**_DO NOT LOOSE THE KEYS!_**

```

$ ./STM32MP_KeyGen_CLI -abs /home/user/KeyFolder/ -pwd qwerty

or

$ openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out privateKey.pem
$ openssl ec -in privateKey.pem -pubout -out publicKey.pem

```
2. You can now use stm32mp1sign	to sign your TF-A (fsbl) binary.
Using stm32mp1sign, the	image is modified in situ. The key path must contain a private key
with a public key included. If a password is not specified, stm32mp1sign will ask for one.
```

$ stm32mp1sign --image path/to/tf-a-binary --key path/to/privkey --sign --password qwerty

```
3. You can also use stm32mp1sign to verify you TF-A (fsbl) binary.
The key path must contain a public key. You can amend the option --pubhash. It outputs a sha256 hash of the public key raw ecpoints in a file.
The usage of --pubhash is not mandatory.
```

$ stm32mp1sign --image path/to/tf-a-binary --key path/to/pubkey --verify --pubhash

```
4. Copy	the hash of the	public key to U-boot and fuse it there. (WARNING!)
```

> tftpboot 0xc0000000 publicKeyHash.bin
> stm32key read 0xc0000000
> stm32key fuse 0xc0000000

```

## Usage with PKCS11 HSM/Smartcard

Example using a Yubikey 5:
```
# This will delete ALL existing keys in the PIV application!
ykman piv reset
# Use Slot 9A (Auth) instead of 9C (Sign), as 9C enforces a second PIN auth that can't be automatically entered.
ykman piv keys generate --algorithm ECCP256 9A /tmp/pubkey.pem --pin-policy NEVER --touch-policy NEVER
ykman piv certificates generate --subject "romkey" 9A /tmp/pubkey.pem -d 365000 -a SHA256

STM32MP1SIGN_SIGN_PIN=123456 ./build/stm32mp1sign --key "pkcs11:token=romkey" --engine pkcs11 --image u-boot-spl.stm32 --osslconf openssl.cnf --sign
STM32MP1SIGN_SIGN_PIN=123456 ./build/stm32mp1sign --key "pkcs11:token=romkey" --engine pkcs11 --image u-boot-spl.stm32 --osslconf openssl.cnf --verify
```

For actual usage use the import instead of generate function and keep the key in **at least** two separate locations!
